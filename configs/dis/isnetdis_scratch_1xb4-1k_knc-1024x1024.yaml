# Cache data spatial size
# To handle large size input images, which take a lot of time for loading in training,
# introduce cache mechanism for pre-convering and resizing the jpg and png images into .pt file
cache:
  cache_size: [1024, 1024]  # cached input spatial resolution

  # Indicates wheather to load all the training datasets into RAM
  # True will greatly speed the training process while requires more RAM

# Data augmentation parameters
augmentation:
  input_size: [1024, 1024]  # model input spatial size, usually use the same value hypar["cache_size"], which means we don't further resize the images
  crop_size: [920, 920]     # random crop size from the input, it is usually set as smaller than hypar["cache_size"], e.g., [920,920] for data augmentation
